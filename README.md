(https://automationexercise.com/)
***

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines a basic test plan for automating core functionalities of the Automation Exercise website.  The purpose is to demonstrate the ability to write and execute automated tests for a web application.

**2. Scope**

This test plan focuses on automating three core functionalities of the website:

Test Case 1: Login with valid credentials - This test verifies a successful user login using predefined credentials.

Test Case 2: Search for a specific product - This test validates the search functionality by searching for a specific product name and verifying the results.

Test Case 3: Checkout Process - This test automates the process of adding a product to the cart, proceeding to checkout, and entering sample billing information.


**3. Tools and Technologies**

• Programming language: JavaScript

• Automation framework: Cypress.io

• Web browser: Chrome

***

**6. Reporting**

Test execution results will be logged to the console or a file for review. Screenshots can be captured for failed tests to illustrate the issue.
***

**7. Schedule and Resources**

This is a basic test plan and can be executed within a short timeframe, a few hours.  The resources required include a development environment with the chosen programming language, automation framework, and web browser installed.

**8. Risks and Mitigation**

• Website changes: The website functionality might change over time, requiring updates to the test scripts.

• Mitigation: The test scripts will be designed with maintainability in mind, making updates easier to implement.
